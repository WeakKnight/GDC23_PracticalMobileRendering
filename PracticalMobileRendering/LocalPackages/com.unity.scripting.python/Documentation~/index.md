# Python Scripting

Python Scripting facilitates Unity's interaction with various media and
entertainment industry applications and ensures that you can integrate Unity
into a broader production pipeline seamlessly. Potential benefits of using
Python in your Unity project include:

- Automating scene and sequence assembly in the context of using Unity as a 
real-time renderer.
- Automating time consuming tasks like duplicating or modifying a large 
quantity of Assets.
- Authoring custom editor tools that could both use complex UI elements and 
interact natively with other DCC suites.

Python Scripting provides:
* A [Python Script Editor](PythonScriptEditor.md) window principally aimed at
  Technical Artists who want to run short scripts and easily create new menu
  items that run Python code.
* An [API](inProcessAPI.md) aimed at Pipeline Technical Directors
  who want to call studio scripts implemented in Python from C# and vice versa.
* [Project Settings](settings.md).
* Installing and loading [Pip Packages](settings.md#pipPackages).
